##About

This app allows users to register a username, age and occupation and enter a database of "recent encounters" with aliens on Mars. The user is allowed to then submit their own encounter into the database. This is my first time using Angular 2 and working with a database. THe app was built to be viewed on mobile devices. 

##Technologies Used 

- Angular 2
- ES2015
- CSS/Animations
- JSON
- Typescript
- HTML


## Things to improve

- Create a prompt that tells users that there is a missing field.
